## ‚ú® Features

The features integrated within this repository stems from my workflows.

#### Allows for machine specific configurations

My workflows use different machines with slightly different configuration, tools, and usage. For example, my work machine has VPN shortcuts which I do not want to commit to this repository.

See adding [custom local configs](#optional-add-custom-local-configurations).

#### Budget version of [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) for directory traverse: `bm` and `goto`

For those have not checked out [z](https://github.com/rupa/z), I recommend trying it out for fast travels between directories. This repository provides a *budget version* of `z`, powered by [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): `bm (bookmark)` and `goto`.

- `bm` bookmarks the current directory.
- `goto` fast travels to the directory e.g. `goto foo`, where `foo` is a fuzzy match to the full path.
- On name conflict, `fzf` window will be spawned.

#### Notes Taking

This repository provides shortcuts to enable [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) style of note taking. It depends on [Neovim](neovim.io) and [telekasten.nvim](https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim) plugin.

- Notes are markdown file based. This avoids additional GUI or application to view the notes.
- The followings shortcuts are provided to increase ease of use:

  <details>
    <summary>Shortcuts</summary>
    <br/>

    - `nfind` find notes by title
    - `ngrep` find notes by content grep
    - `ntags` find notes by tags
    - `nnew` create new notes
    - `ntmplnew` create new templated note
    - `npush` commits and push note repository to upstream branch
    - `npull` pull latest changes of note repository from upstream branch
  </details>

  For more information and usage, see [notes.zsh](zsh/config/functions/notes.zsh).

## üß± Components

#### Terminal: [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) (Terminal emulator), [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) (Session manager), [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (Shell), [Zap](https://www.zapzsh.org/) (ZSH plugin manager), [Starship](https://starship.rs/) (prompt)

<details>
  <br/>

  - Due to heavy TUI usage, terminal performance becomes one of the priority. Wezterm is a cross-platform, performant terminal emulator that is able to satisfy the performance requirements and be configured easily.
  - Zellij is used to provide terminal session management and multiplexer.
  - ZSH is battle tested shell that is easily configurable and is widely supported. [Zap](https://www.zapzsh.org/) as plugin manager.
  - Starship as customisable shell prompt.

#### Editor: [Neovim](neovim.io) (Text editor)

<details>
  <br/>

  - Neovim is able to be extensively configured to become a `Personal Development Environment (PDE)`, and having to not use multiple IDE for individual languages is much welcomed.
  - The Neovim has been configured to include LSP, auto-completion, UI and quality of life plugins that I use often.
  - Note taking with [Telekasten.nvim](https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim)

##### `zsh/local_config/*.zsh`

Any `*.zsh` file in this directory will be automatically loaded during ZSH initialisation. You can use this to add additional aliases or functions.

##### `nvim/lua/local_config/(options|keymaps|autocmds).lua`

***options.lua***

Load local Neovim options.

***keymaps.lua***

Load local Neovim keymaps.

***autocmds.lua***

Load local Neovim autocmds.



#### (Optional) Swap Keys

The default key bindings are not the most ergonomic for programmers, and we can perform some key swaps to help make it better. Your hands will thank you!

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>
  <br />

  You can install PowerToys, and configure the mapping through the Keyboard Manager.

  ```Powershell
  winget install Microsoft.PowerToys --source winget
  ```

  Perform the swap between `Esc` and `Caps Lock` by adding two entries:
  - `Esc` to `Caps Lock`
  - `Caps Lock` to `Esc`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>MacOS</summary>
  <br />

  Newer MacOS has native support for mapping keyboard modifier keys.

  Go to *System Preferences* &rarr; *Keyboard* &rarr; *Modifier Keys*:
  - `Caps Lock` to `Esc`
  - `fn` to `Control`

  > NOTE: Yes, we are losing the `Caps Lock` and `fn` buttons with this mapping. If you use these keys often, this is not for you.

</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

```sh
./setup.sh [-h] [-v] [--git_user git_user] [--git_user_email git_user_email] [--git_user_local_file path_to_file]
                     [--golang_tag golang_semver]
```

I have prepared a script that automates the rest of the configuration. The script has **tons** of user confirmation; (i) partly to ensure that the user knows what is happening and (ii) partly to allow the user to skip specific configurations.

*Feel free to run the setup script for fun and skip all configurations to see what would be configured.*

I have done my best to ensure that the script is:
- **Idempotent** i.e. able to be run multiple times without any side effects.
- **Backs up** any existing configuration if a replacement needs to be made.

> NOTE: Many dependencies require some sort of shell integration script; these are already integrated within the ZSH configurations. See [exports.zsh](zsh/config/exports.zsh). If you decide to skip using this repository ZSH configurations, please remember to integrate the dependencies.

> NOTE: For Windows, please create a symbolic link for **wezterm.lua** from the Wezterm installation directory to the Wezterm configuration. Below is a sample command for Powershell.
> ```Powershell
> # Given installation dir: "C:\Program Files\Wezterm"
> # Given local repository configuration: "\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\anthonyhalim\repos\personal\dotfiles"
> New-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\WezTerm\wezterm.lua" -ItemType SymbolicLink -Value "\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\anthonyhalim\repos\personal\dotfiles\wezterm\wezterm.lua"
> ```

Below is a screenshot of a snippet of the script run:

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Why not use third-party keyboard managers?**

> There are lots of third-party softwares that aid key swapping to an extensive degree of customisation (for example, [Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) for MacOS, [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape) for Linux). However, you may not want (or be allowed) to install third-party software that customises close to the firmware level.
>
> Due to this, I opt to use built-in or officially supported by the OS, albeit it supports less extensive customisation.
>
> If you are using third-party software, an idea for customisation is:
> - On `Caps Lock` tap, map it as `Esc`.
> - On `Caps Lock` hold, map it as `Ctrl`.


**Q: The Diatheke module is not installed correctly.**
> Try to completely uninstall module `installmgr -u <module_name>` and rerun `./setup.sh` again.


**Q: The [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) Neovim plugin is not installed correctly.**
> Try to upgrade `Node` and `npm` to the latest version and restart Neovim.
